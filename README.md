# Crowdfunding_Analysis
UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp- Excel

For this assignment, I created two new analyses from the kickstarter campaign data in the Excel sheet above. I took a closer look at outcomes (failed, successful, canceled or live) based on monetary campaign goals. I also looked at outcomes based on the campaigns' launch date. This allowed me to choose the best time of the year to start a kickstarter campaign and allowed me to adjust my fundraising goal to increase the likelihood of success. 
## Tools
For this analysis, I used a dataset on previous campaigns on Microsoft Excel. I used filters and Excel formulas to create new, more manageable and relevant datasets. With the refined data, I created visulaizations using charts and pivot tables to more easily interpret the summary data. 
### Outcomes Based on Goals

I noticed that between goals of 5,000 dollars and 25,000 dollars, there is a moderate rate of success in kickstarter fundraising success. It seems to be the range where a campaign might have close to a 50/50 chance of success or failure. Having a lower goal is obviously going to increase the rate of success as the graph points out as well. Asking for a lesser amount of money makes the goal more easily fulfilled. 
#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

There was a high rate of success of kickstarter campaigns that began during the summer months, with May having the most promise. The rates of success decrease towards the closing of the year. This is likely because of holiday spending taking priority over donating to kickstarter campaigns. 
Along with success in summer months, kickstarter campaigns fail at a steady rate as well. This suggests to me that these specific months are the most active times for kickstarter campaign donations in general. 
##### Future Studies
It would be helpful to do more research into the spending habits of the general public throughout different times of the year. This could possibly put things into perspective when attempting to choose a launch date for your campaign. I would also like to see a visulaization of the types of kickstarters people tend to support. Maybe campaigns with a braoder, wordly message or purpose will do better than a play, for example.
